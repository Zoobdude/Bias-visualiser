# Bias visualiser

A little python program that creates a bar chart (in the CLI) to show any bias in a array (which in this case I have populated with random numbers).


## Usage

1. Run `main.py`
2. Enter the range (number of bars)
3. Enter the number of generations (number of random ints)
4. Save output as file (y/n)
5. Profit.
